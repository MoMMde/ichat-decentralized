# ichat-decentralized
Internet UDP based messaging protocol fully Decentralized and Peer2Peer

ichat is running on two threads
the main thread is running the command line whilst the second is handeling the udp requests

there is currently no security built-in.

use **/help** to see what is possible

**/disconnet** not working yet! (easy fix)
